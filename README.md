#HT&PY
HT&PY is an simple HTTP & HTTPS web-server written in Python from ground up.

It allows complete customisation of the server to suit a range of requirements.

#Pre-Requisites
The server does not need any pre-requisites other than python 2.7 with the standard libraries.

If PHP support is a requirement then GCC and python dev tools are needed as well as a POSIX system.

For HTTPS support Open-SSL is required.
