HTTP
----
My implementation of HTTP is quite basic and a lot functionality is missing(I.E:- Caching,Compression,etc).


PHP
---
I am sorry if any PHP functionality is missing;There is next to no documentation(that I could find) on PHP and server integration.
(I know the way I implemented php is crappy but I couldnt think of a better way that wouldnt become a whole other project on its own).

There is an known memory overflow in my current implementation of php;when you try to load a php from within a php file using "file('http://server:port/somephpfile.php');" the php gives an out of memory exception,tbh i have no idea why....(If you figure this one out pls let me know! any help is greatly appreciated).

SSL/HTTPS
---------
The server is designed to use the best available SSL suite(this is default option with the ssl library),but the security may vary greatly with local OpenSSL installation,to improve security I recomend updating SSL regularly and recompiling python with new ssl support. 
*Note:Certificate files should be stored in "Server_Files/SSL_Cert/" and the file names be updated in settings column of the main server code.
By default SSL is turned off and will need to be turned on if you want SSL support.
SSL server runs as a separate instance of the http server on a new process,and will create its own threads etc.


MIME:
-----
To add further mime types edit the mime.typ.shb file, using a text editor, in the Server_Files directory


File Handling(PHP):
------------------
I could not figure out how to send file objects over to the $_FILES variable in PHP.
Thus I made a short cut,I placed the name of the Temporary file in the POST_FILE_PATH variable.
In PHP this Variable can be accessed by using "$_SERVER['POST_FILE_PATH']".
If the file was a file upload to the server an addition variable,POST_FILE_NAME, will be set.
This variable can be accessed by "$_SERVER['POST_FILE_NAME']" it will contain the name of the file being sent.


File Upload example using the servers system on PHP:
---------------------------------------------------------
<?php
$uploadfile = $_SERVER['POST_FILE_PATH'];

echo '<pre>';
if ($uploadfile != ""){
if (rename($uploadfile, $_SERVER['POST_FILE_NAME'])) {
    echo "File is valid, and was successfully uploaded.\n";
} else {
    echo "ERROR!\n";
}
}else{
	echo "Not a file upload.\n";
}

echo 'Here is some more debugging info:';
echo($uploadfile);

print "</pre>";
?>

There are some useful snippets of code which may help you in Server_Files/Other.
